Here , I learnt about Android developpment by kotlin, and a bit of backend part by internshaala trainings , I completed the course and was able to develop some intresting Apps like 

Bookhub : the app displays some set of books from local database using ROOM libraries, and a drawer layout with multiple sections have been added , user can add a book to favourites , it will be stored locally and and also he can sort books by ratings
